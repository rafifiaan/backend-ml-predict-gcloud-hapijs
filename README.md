## Applied Machine Learning with Google Cloud 

**Create a Backend Web Service (APIs) with the Hapi.js framework and deploy with Docker + Cloud Run**

Note: </br> 
- Use **deploy.sh** to deploy with Cloud Run via CLI (same directory with Dockerfile)
```
./deploy.sh
```
- PORT=8080 in server.js (no need to expose the port in the Dockerfile)
